Rules of Hangman:

-A word will be picked up at random from a list of 100 possible words

-You will see a display where each of the letters is replaced by an underscore ( _ )

-You have to guess the word by choosing a letter at a time

-After each guess, if that letter is included in our hidden word, you will be able to see it instead of the underscore

-The more letters you guess, the easier it will be to guess the whole word

-If you can guess the word with less than 6 incorrect guesses, you win!
